Last month I attended [DDD Melbourne](https://www.dddmelbourne.com/) which this year celebrated it's tenth anniversary. DDD is a community driven developer conference run in all major Australian cities. The name DDD stems from Developer Developer Developer which probably has you thinking of an exacerbated Steve Balmer pacing on stage with giant sweat patches. Luckily the speakers are generally quite a bit less "wild". The roots of the conference are definitely with the Microsoft community and in the early years, the majority of topics were focussed on the Microsoft stack. Gradually I feel the conference has become more balanced with new tracks added and a great variety of talks presented.

I've had the pleasure of attending all but the first installment and it's something I look forward to every year. This year there were five separate tracks to chose from and after reading through the synopsis for [all the talks](https://www.dddmelbourne.com/agenda) I ended up with the following list:

 - [Rob Earlam](https://twitter.com/RobEarlam) - An introduction to Docker and Containers
 - Michael King - Micro front ends
 - [Effy Elden](https://twitter.com/ineffyble) - False Assumptions Developers Make About Gender (and their sometimes hilarious results)
 - [Charles Korn](https://charleskorn.com/) - Dockerised local build and testing environments made easy
 - [Raphael Haddad](https://twitter.com/RaphHaddadAus) - Time Throughout the Ages
 - [Stephen Kennedy](https://twitter.com/DevEnable) - Architectural Reviews for Mere Mortals
 - [Tim Comport](https://twitter.com/timcomport) - Reverse Engineering a Classic Video Game

The talks were all great and I took something away from all of them. A successful talk is one were I not only learn something new, but walk away hungry to delve further into the topic.

I'm using Docker for our local development builds for the project I'm currently on and it was great to get some insights from Rob and Charles on how to configure and run an effective local environment. I'm always looking to optimise my local development workflow to create the shortest possible feedback loop and both had some great tips. Charles gave a demo of a CLI tool he's built that automates generation of Docker-based build and test environments. It felt a bit like docker-compose on steroids to me and I'm hoping to get some time to give the tool a proper run. Check out the [source on GitHub](https://github.com/charleskorn/batect) 

Effy's talk was probably the most thought-provoking of the lot and challenged me to identify and eliminate any unconscious bias I may be applying while developing software. This can be quite challenging which the number of great examples of poor user experience clearly showed. The examples highlighted that bias, specifically when dealing with sex and gender, is ingrained in a large number online forms. The talk gave me another lens to use when evaluating the code and user interfaces I produce (or are asked to produce).

Tim's talk was probably the most technically impressive of the talks I attended. It was very demo-heavy and showed some impressive techniques involving deep dives into a hex editor to uncover the hidden secrets of the game BioForge. It felt like an advanced bit of detective work, or perhaps a complex puzzle, where you uncover more and more clues and finally arrive with a full picture.

Thanks as always to the organizers and to the volunteers for hosting and running such a great event. I'm looking forward to attending again next year!
