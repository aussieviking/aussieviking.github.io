I made some improvements to the blog yesterday and seeing as this a a software engineering blog, I figured it was appropriate that I write up some release notes. Although the blog was "released" over a month ago, I feel that I am now happy to give it a v1 stamp.

# New Features
- Dark Mode!

I'm a big fan of the recent trend of including dark mode support in software. It seems everyone's embracing this throw-back to the earlier days of computing where the only option were terminal windows with white-on-black or a [green screen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monochrome_monitor). Most browsers, editors and even operating systems now come with dark mode as an option. 

But what about web pages? Most pages are still resembling word documents with white backgrounds and black text. That's why I got (probably a bit too) excited when I came across [this post from Tom Brow](https://tombrow.com/dark-mode-website-css). With a few lines of CSS, my blog is now looking much more to my liking!

<style type="text/css" rel="stylesheet">
    img { border: 0.5px solid #e39777; }
</style>

I have more or less ~~stolen~~ borrowed the exact styles he has in his post so all credit goes to him. Here are the current rules:

```scss
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
    body {
        background-color: #444;
        color: #e4e4e4;
    }
    a {
        color: #e39777 !important;

        &:visited,
        &:active,
        &:hover {
            color: #e4e4e4;
        }
    }
    img {
        filter: grayscale(30%);
    }

    // reverse text color for code blocks as
    // they are displayed on a light background
    .highlight,
    .highlighter-rouge {
        color: #111;
    }
}
```

I actually had some trouble getting Jekyll to render this. As I like to keep my code neat and tidy I wanted to put these styles in a separate file and `@import` it from my main scss file as. I followed the process [as described in the documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/assets/) but unfortunately I wasn't able to get it to work so I ended up having to add the styles directly into my main.scss file ðŸ˜ž This may be a Windows specific issue as I found a post on SO [reporting the same behavior](https://stackoverflow.com/q/54956758/202).

In writing this post I also noticed that the rule caused the code block above to be illegible. The default syntax highlighter styles displays the code with a light background which obviously isn't ideal if you have a light text. I might have to play around with this a bit but for now I've just added an override rule to make the text dark inside code blocks.
